You've reached a relatively empty page belonging to Saulius Lukauskas.
I've replaced my old blog with something more of a placeholder for now
which is designed to hold my up to date contact details.

As of this day I am based in Munich and work as postdoctoral Researcher at Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen
in [Institute of Functional Epigenetics](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/ife/index.html).

You can contact me through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sauliuslukauskas/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukauskas_).
